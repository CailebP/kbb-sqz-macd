Simulation of a particular scenario the car may be going through.
A YAML description file.

Car will stop behind a double parked vehicle.

The planning simulator.

Relocate the car to left of double parked vehicle.

Goal position.

Degraded state where an internal failure inside of the car ...

Remote assistance front-end perspective ... test the application against these edge cases and scenarios.

System testing engineering team. They are writing the planning scenarios for the particular feature we are building.

How to craft those scenarios and setup a plan ... some ownership in the AV team.

The other side of that is this thing called matrix ... not interact with much (his team) but could be an interesting tool.

A 3D simulation of various road conditions ... entire city of San Francisco modeled.

The planning simulator mocks up all the lightar sensor inputs ...

The matrix thing adds on top of that core behavior testing a 3D model of the world.

Consume through the lidar perception system ... much more extensive testing. Full perception stack involved.

The safety aspect of it too ... when these tests don't work properly ... I really hope that feature I built ... a safety critical event.




There is a call-center with trained people, maybe it is like midnight ... did my code for that button ...

React, Redux, WebRTC (real-time communications protocol) video streams come through that. WebGL for map rendering.

Hosted web app ... Cyprus ... a lot to bite off.
